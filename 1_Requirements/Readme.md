TELEPHONE BILLING SYSTEM 


 #INTRODUCTION 
    In this project I have tried to design a system in which customer can pay their telephone bills .
    when customer comes to the interface the program ask to choose the option they want to use
    and perform some functions like adding records , deleting records and listing all the saved records in the system.
