TELEPHONE BILLING SYSTEM 


 #INTRODUCTION 
    In this project I have tried to design a system in which customer can pay their telephone bills .
    when customer comes to the interface the program ask to choose the option they want to use
    and perform some functions like adding records , deleting records and listing all the saved records in the system.
    
    
 #SWOT ANALYSIS
   
     *STRENGTH
       Easy to use interface and the robustness of the system
     
     *WEAKNESS
       Only perform some basics operation like adding deleting and displaying records
       
     *OPPORTUNITY
       can include more funcationality like pre-paid and post-paid services
       
     *THREATS
       Other compitetors has advance systems for the same operation
